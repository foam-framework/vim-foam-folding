# FOAM Folding for Vim

This is a Vundle/pathogen-friendly plugin for Vim that provides semantic code folding for [http://foamdev.com](FOAM) code.

It folds `CLASS` definitions, `properties`, `methods`, etc. blocks, and individual properties and methods.

It doesn't fold inside the code for any one method, or the components of a property, just the high-level structures.

## Known Issues

It folds `documentation` a little awkwardly.
